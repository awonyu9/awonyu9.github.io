              Here is a short demo of how Heardle++ works:
              <p>
                <video width="500" controls>
                  <source src="assets/video/heardle-plus-plus.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                Your browser does not support the video tag.
                </video>
              </p>
            </p>

            <p>
              Heardle++ is my systems design senior project for my computer science program at Wartburg College.
              It is an improved version of the web game <a href="https://www.spotify.com/heardle/?" alt="Link to Heardle">Heardle</a>, and is based on two core ideas:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  The user should be able to quiz themselves on songs they might actually know - and not arbitrarily chosen "popular"
                  Western songs.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The user should be able to play as many times as they want, and not just once per day.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </p>

            <div class="image">
              <img src="assets/img/portfolio/heardle-plus-plus-1.png" alt="Heardle++ playlist selection phase" />
              <h6>Fig. 1: Playlist selection phase in Heardle++</h6>
            </div>

            <p>
              From these two ideas was born Heardle++, a music quiz web app in which people with Spotify accounts can
              log in, select any of their public, private, shared and liked playlists, listen to a short preview of a random song from the chosen playlist, and quiz themselves on their own library's
              songs, as many times as they want.
            </p>

              <h6>Fig. 2: Guessing phase in Heardle++</h6>
            </div>

            <p>
              This project is completed, although I have no plans of deploying it. All the core functionalities have
              been implemented and the game works as intended. That includes: OAuth with the Spotify Accounts service via an Express
              server, the game fetching all the user&apos;s playlist and track data, then displaying all of the playlists for the user to
              select, picking one song at random from the chosen playlist, playing a short preview of the audio, giving the user suggestions of songs from that playlist that match their input as they type, and the user
              being able to replay right away.
            </p>

              I still need to fix some minor bugs and quality-of-life issues,
              but feel free to check out my project on GitHub!</p>
